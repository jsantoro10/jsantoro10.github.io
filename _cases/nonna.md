  challenges:
    - No menu item pictures
    - No online order options
    - No estimate for order completion
  opportunities:

  competitive_analysis:

    pain_points:
      - No single sign-on (SSO)
      - No special instructions option
ideation:
  summary: Using the **Crazy Eights exercise**, I sketched out different iterations of the homepage with these user pain points and improvement opportunities in mind.
  before: My initial sketches focused on **shortcuts to key user goals** featured on the homepage.
  after: For the refined version, I prioritized a **quick and easy ordering process** with offers, popular dishes, and favorites featured.
wireframes:
  summary: As the initial design phase continued, I created digital wireframes based on peer feedback and findings from the user research.

testing:
  notes:
    - I conducted **two rounds of usability studies**.
    - Findings from the first study helped **guide** the designs from wireframes to mockups.
    - The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed **refining**.
  study_type: Unmoderated
  location: United States
  participants: 5 participants
  length: 20-30 minutes
  image: test.gif
  tests:
    - Sign up to create new account.
    - Select menu item and add to cart.
    - Complete checkout for pickup order.
    - Track progress of order. Return to home once order is complete.
  insights:
    - Users want easy access to the **full menu**
    - Users want to use **familiar navigation styles** (e.g. scrolling and searching) on the homepage
    - Users want to order with **as little steps** as possible
    - Users want easy access to **current and past orders**
final_designs:
  - title: Single Sign-On and 2FA
    summary: I provided single-sign on options for the most commonly used platforms, as well as two-factor authentication for a quicker login process.

  - title: Loyalty Discounts
    summary: I added a popup to apply offers on the checkout page to encourage use of the app, as well as a quicker checkout process.

  - title: Order Estimates
    summary: I provided two options, ‘ASAP’ and ‘Schedule,’ for pickup and delivery times for users with unpredictable schedules.

  - title: Live Order Tracking
    summary: I added live order tracking, with each step of the process listed, so that users with busy schedules could time their pickup accurately.

takeaways:
  summary: This was my **first portfolio project** in the Google UX Design certificate program, as well as my **first experience designing with Figma**. Throughout Courses 2-5, I began practicing and implementing the principles I was learning about. Watching my designs come to life and receiving user feedback was an **extremely rewarding and insightful process**.
  lessons:
    - lesson: Navigation
      learning: I learned that prioritizing the user means understanding the existing navigational patterns and information architecture that they are familiar with.
    - lesson: Accessibility
      learning: I learned that designing for people who use assistive technologies improves the user experience for all users through icons, bottom navigation bars, and an accessible color palette.
    - lesson: Labels
      learning: I learned that all button labels and CTAs should use language that is straightforward and understandable for users regardless of their familiarity with similar food ordering apps.
  next_steps:
    - Conduct a third usability study to evaluate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed
    - Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need
