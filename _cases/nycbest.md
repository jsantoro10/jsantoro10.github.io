testing:
  notes:
    - I conducted **two rounds of usability studies**.
    - Findings from the first study helped **guide** the designs from wireframes to mockups.
    - The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed **refining**.
  study_type: Unmoderated
  location: United States
  participants: 5 participants
  length: 20-30 minutes

takeaways:
  summary: This was my **first portfolio project** in the Google UX Design certificate program, as well as my **first experience designing with Figma**. Throughout Courses 2-5, I began practicing and implementing the principles I was learning about. Watching my designs come to life and receiving user feedback was an **extremely rewarding and insightful process**.
  lessons:
    - lesson: Navigation
      learning: I learned that prioritizing the user means understanding the existing navigational patterns and information architecture that they are familiar with.
    - lesson: Accessibility
      learning: I learned that designing for people who use assistive technologies improves the user experience for all users through icons, bottom navigation bars, and an accessible color palette.
    - lesson: Labels
      learning: I learned that all button labels and CTAs should use language that is straightforward and understandable for users regardless of their familiarity with similar food ordering apps.
  next_steps:
    - Conduct a third usability study to evaluate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed
    - Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need
