sitemap:
  summary: "**Difficulty with website navigation** was a primary pain point for users, so I aimed to make the information architecture **simple and intuitive**. I created the sitemap with the common structure used by existing animal shelters in mind."
testing:
  notes:
    - I conducted **two rounds of usability studies**.
    - Findings from the first study helped **guide** the designs from wireframes to mockups.
    - The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed **refining**.
  study_type: Unmoderated
  location: United States
  participants: 5 participants
  length: 20-30 minutes

  tests:
    - Sign up to create new account.
    - Select menu item and add to cart.
    - Complete checkout for pickup order.
    - Track progress of order. Return to home once order is complete.
  insights:
    - Users want easy access to the **full menu**
    - Users want to use **familiar navigation styles** (e.g. scrolling and searching) on the homepage
    - Users want to order with **as little steps** involved as possible
    - Users want easy access to **current and past orders**
final_designs:
  - title: Single Sign-On and 2FA

takeaways:
  summary: "This was my **first portfolio project** in the Google UX Design certificate program, as well as my **first experience designing with Figma**. Throughout Courses 2-5, I began practicing and implementing the principles I was learning about. Watching my designs come to life and receiving user feedback was an **extremely rewarding and insightful process**."
  lessons:
    - lesson: Color Theory
      learning: I learned how much of an impact the color palette has on the overall impression and energy of a site. After changing the initial color scheme to a more vibrant purple, the site felt more suited to the modern, tailored-to-you concept I had in mind for NYC’s Best.
    - lesson: Accessibility
      learning: I learned that designing for people who use assistive technologies improves the user experience for all users through icons, bottom navigation bars, and an accessible color palette.
    - lesson: Labels
      learning: I learned that all button labels and CTAs should use language that is straightforward and understandable for users regardless of their familiarity with similar food ordering apps.
  next_steps:
    - Conduct a third usability study to evaluate whether the pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed
    - Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need
