    - Concept
    - Research
    - Visuals

  duration: Dec 2022 - Feb 2023
  tool: Adobe XD
  problem: Available pet adoption websites have cluttered designs that **aren’t fully responsive, inefficient** or **unusable browsing features**, and **confusing information architecture**.
  solution:
    tag: Design a user-friendly responsive website by providing **clear navigation** and offering a **fast, efficient** pet search and adoption application process.
research:
  description: To understand the users I was designing for and their needs, I conducted qualitative research through a **competitive audit**, **empathy maps**, **interviews**, and **personas**.
  questions:
    - Who are our users?
    - What are their goals?
    - What features are needed for users to achieve these goals?
  target:
    description: The primary user group identified through my research was **working adults with families** and **early career professionals** who don’t have time to read through each pet profile.

    competitors:

ideation:
  summary: Next, I sketched out four different iterations of the homepage, with a focus on avoiding a text-heavy screen for a quicker browsing experience.
  diagram:

    description: For the refined version, I prioritized a **quick and easy way to search pet profiles** with filters like location and pet type to help users save time.
wireframes:
  summary: For my digital wireframes, I prioritized **multiple ways to enter the user flow** through landmarks, such as navigation and search.

sitemap:
  summary: "**Difficulty with website navigation** was a primary pain point for users, so I aimed to make the information architecture **simple and intuitive**. I created the sitemap with the common structure used by existing animal shelters in mind."
testing:
  notes:
    - I conducted a usability study to **evaluate the navigation and layout** of the low-fidelity prototype.
    - The findings from this usability study revealed new perspectives on **intuitive navigation** and how to design a **more efficient user flow**.
  study_type: Unmoderated
  location: United States
  participants: 5 participants
  length: 20-30 minutes
  image: test.gif
  tests:
    - View adoptable pet profiles.
    - Select a cat profile.
    - Apply to adopt the cat.
    - Schedule an appointment to meet them.
  insights:
    - Users want to **begin the scheduling process directly** from the pet profile page.
    - Users want to **navigate directly to the pet profile page** from the listings page, instead of viewing a preview first.
    - Users want to **skip non-applicable questions** on the adoption application.
final_designs:
  - title: Efficient Pet Search Flow
    summary: "I designed multiple ways to view adoptable pets from the homepage: search filters, pet category, and the top ‘Adopt’ navigation tab (out of frame)."
    image: design1.png
  - title: Search Filters
    summary: I added multiple descriptive filters, such as ‘Good with’ and ‘Care,’ for a customizable search. I also added a ‘Browse by Personality’ section for first-time pet parents who may not know what to look for.
    image: design2.png
  - title: CTAs
    summary: I placed two clear CTA’s, ‘Adopt’ and ‘Meet,’ along with a breakdown of the adoption process above the fold on the pet profile page to address the pain point of unclear information architecture.
    image: design3.png
  - title: Application Retention
    summary: I added a fixed bottom bar with the number of application questions answered thus far. Based on feedback from the usability study that the application involved a lot of scrolling, I aimed to ‘gamify’ the application experience.

takeaways:
  summary: This was my **second portfolio project** in the Google UX Design certificate program, as well as my **first experience designing with Adobe XD**. Designing for a bigger screen for the first time felt very daunting initially, but I learned to appreciate the blank real estate and the value of white space.
  lessons:
    - lesson: Color Theory
      learning: I learned how much of an impact the color palette has on the overall impression and energy of a site. After changing the initial color scheme to a more vibrant purple, the site felt more suited to the modern, tailored-to-you concept I had in mind for NYC’s Best.
    - lesson: Design Sprint
      learning: I learned that defining what is and isn’t within the project scope is an essential aspect of designing under time constraints. Unlike the first portfolio project for the Google UX Design course, multiple steps of the design process were outlined in a week’s work. This structure gave me some experience tackling weekly design sprints.
    - lesson: Application
      learning: Creating an adoption application that was both visually engaging and easy to fill out proved to be a bigger challenge than I anticipated. My first attempt received feedback that it was too lengthy and there was too much scrolling. For my second attempt, I played with the placement of the response boxes and incorporated elements from existing solutions like Survey Monkey.
  next_steps:
    - Conduct more user research with underrepresented groups to determine any new areas of need and ideate on new features.
    - Conduct more user research with underrepresented groups to determine any new areas of need and ideate on new features.
