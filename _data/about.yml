overview:
  - My love for talking to people, learning about their context and needs, and problem solving has led me from cancer patient care to community management to technical recruiting. All of these roles have solidified my passion for creative problem solving through designing experiences that prioritize the voice of the user.
  - In my community management role at a DTC e-commerce brand, I researched customer trends and insights and turned them into growth initiatives, crafted customer-facing language for product launches and CX workflows, and curated UGC for the brandâ€™s social and website content. This experience with visual and verbal storytelling taught me how to communicate with different stakeholders.
  - Through my role as a technical recruiter, I built a rapport with senior software developers and gained an understanding of the tools and frameworks they use in their day-to-day. Learning about the process of building a product fueled my passion for learning how to design products myself, and led me to complete the Google UX Design Certificate program.
  - I create thoughtful, insight-driven solutions that drive empathy and impact by bridging user needs and business goals, transforming engagement, and empowering users.
