overview:
  - I’m a product designer with a love for creating thoughtful, insight-driven solutions by placing the voice of the user at the forefront of the design process.
  - My passion for understanding how products are built led me to the technical recruiting space, where I worked with backend software engineers to match their personal and professional goals to a role.
  - Before that, I managed the online community on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for a DTC e-commerce brand. I transformed customer trends and insights into growth initiatives, crafted customer-facing language for product launches and CX workflows, and curated UGC for the brand’s social and website content.
  - I graduated from New York University in December 2019 with a double major in Applied Psychology and Global Public Health and a minor in Sociology.
  - Aside from design, I enjoy [exploring NYC by bike](/bike) and creating shortform content.
