overview:
  - I’m a UX Designer with a passion for building intuitive, accessible products that make users’ lives easier.
  - My passion for understanding how products are built led me to the technical recruiting space, where I worked with backend software engineers to achieve their personal and professional goals.
  - Before that, I worked in the e-commerce space managing the brand’s community on social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook) and curating UGC for its social and website content.
  - I graduated from New York University in December 2019 with a double major in Applied Psychology and Global Public Health and a minor in Sociology.
  - Aside from design, I enjoy [exploring NYC by bike](/bike) and creating shortform content.
